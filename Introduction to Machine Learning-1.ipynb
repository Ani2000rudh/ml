Clustering, density \nestimation, and reconstruction-based methods are common unsupervised learning techniques used for \nanomaly detection. These algorithms are trained on a large dataset of normal behavior or events to identify \nanomalies. Anomalous data points can then be investigated further to determine whether they are indicative of \nany unusual or abnormal behavior or events. Unsupervised learning techniques are well-suited for anomaly detection since they do not require\nlabeled data and can identify anomalies based solely on the properties of the input data.'''",
